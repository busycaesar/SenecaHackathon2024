    "body": "The much-anticipated comeback of the annual Seneca Hackathon is here, and the event is poised to kick off this February. The organizers have chosen to center this year's event on the theme of \"housing\" in response to the pressing challenges of Canada's housing crisis. Motivated by a sense of urgency and social responsibility, the decision to focus on housing solutions arises from its alarming impact on vulnerable populations, particularly international students, and even indigenous communities.\n\"The subtler motivations emerged during our conversations with elders from Wasauksing First Nation, where we gained insight into the acute housing crisis affecting indigenous peoples. This revelation fueled our determination to make a positive impact and offer solutions”, said Mark Buchner, the Hackathon Chair. He also added that the support in addressing housing challenges of Thinking North, a sponsor from the previous event, contributed to their firm dedication to the theme.\nThis year’s hackathon aims to address a spectrum of challenges and opportunities within the housing sector by strategically breaking down the overarching problem into manageable \"challenge sets\" jointly with its sponsors and partners. This approach allows participants to tackle specific aspects of the issue, such as student housing, social housing, indigenous housing, and the viewpoints of builders, developers, financiers, and various levels of government—municipal, provincial, or federal.\nAccording to Mark, the solutions that they are expecting this year are mainly focused on cost reduction. “It’s intricately linked to enhancing efficiency, streamlining paperwork and administration, and exploring innovative financing solutions through technology”, he said. These priorities highlight the practical and transformative impact of the initiatives that will be developed during the Hackathon.\nAs we look forward to the innovations that will come out of this year's event, it is important to recognize the collaborative efforts and shared dedication pushing this meaningful event forward. With the support of sponsors and the creative energy of participants, we have the potential to turn challenges into opportunities and make significant strides toward ensuring safe and affordable housing for everyone.",

    "body": "Organizers of the hackathon has made a couple of improvements to further enrich the overall experience for all stakeholders involved, most especially its participants.\nParticipating teams can look forward to several unique elements this year. “We have designed the hackathon this year to optimize participant engagement and ensure high-quality output”, said Mark Buchner, when asked what makes the upcoming hackathon different from the previous ones. “Enhanced digital element strategies were incorporated and new positions were added in the organizing team to ensure a more inclusive and engaging experience for all participants”, he added.\nBuilding on lessons learned from previous hackathon events, among the deliberate shifts and improvements this year includes a greater emphasis on its adjudication processes, e-commerce integration, and the effective management of operational issues which may arise at any period during the entire stretch of this year’s hackathon event.\nNew and specialized roles were introduced to cater to a more diverse skillset, thereby strengthening the team’s overall operational efficiency. “We have added new positions in our expanded team such as Issues Management Specialist, VIP Experience Coordinator, Business Analyst and Communications Specialist, among others”, Mark revealed. As of the moment, there are 62 dedicated volunteer organizers in the hackathon, and it is expected to reach more than a hundred members as the event unfolds.\nWhile there are notable refinements, the foundational structure of the 2024 Housing Hackathon remains similar with its highly successful past events. Staying true to its mission, vision, and manifesto, Seneca Hackathon continues to prioritize a diverse team composition, ensuring inclusivity for all students, cultivating a fun working environment, and committed to deliver a practical learning opportunity to students.",
